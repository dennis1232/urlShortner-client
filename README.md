Here’s a more conversational and human-friendly version of your **README** for the client side of the **URL Shortener** application:

---

# **URL Shortener Client**

Welcome to the frontend of the **URL Shortener** app! This is where users can easily create short URLs, set expiration times, and track how many times their short URLs are clicked—all powered by **React**.

## **What This Client Does**

- Allows you to generate short URLs from long ones.
- Lets you set how long the short URL should be active (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or never expire).
- Displays the generated short URL for sharing.
- Shows simple analytics (how many times the URL was clicked), which you can toggle on and off.

## **Tech Stack**

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making requests to the backend API.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the app in a clean and modern way.

## **What You Need**

- **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed on your machine.

### **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to get the app up and running on your local machine.

### 1. **Clone the Project**

First, download the project by cloning it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortener-client.git
```

### 2. **Go to the Client Folder**

Move into the project folder:

```bash
cd url-shortener-client
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Install all the necessary packages to get the project going:

```bash
npm install
# or if you're using yarn
yarn install
```

### 4. **Set Up the Environment**

Create a `.env` file in the project’s root folder and add the base URL where your backend is running (usually `http://localhost:5001`).

```bash
# .env
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

Make sure your backend server is up and running!

### 5. **Start the Client**

Now let’s get the app running. Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
# or if you're using yarn
yarn start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and you should see the app in action.

## **How the Project is Organized**

Here’s a quick overview of how the project is structured:

```bash
src/
│
├── api/              # Where API requests (like creating short URLs) live
├── components/       # All the React components that build the app (UrlForm, ShortUrlDisplay, Analytics)
├── styles/           # Tailwind CSS styles
├── App.tsx           # The main component where everything comes together
└── index.tsx         # Entry point for the React app
```

### **Main Components**

- **UrlForm**: Where users input their long URL and choose the expiration time.
- **ShortUrlDisplay**: This shows the generated short URL, with a toggle for showing or hiding analytics.
- **Analytics**: Displays how many times the short URL has been clicked.

## **How to Use the App**

- **Enter a Long URL**: In the input field, paste the long URL that you want to shorten.
- **Set Expiration Time** (Optional): Select how long the short URL should be active from the dropdown (or leave it to never expire).
- **Generate Short URL**: Hit the "Shorten URL" button, and the app will give you a short URL.
- **Show Analytics**: You can toggle the analytics on or off to see how many times your URL has been clicked.

## **Running Commands**

Here are some useful commands you can run inside the project directory:

### **`npm start`**

Starts the app in development mode. You can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### **`npm test`**

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Use this to check if everything works as expected.

### **`npm run build`**

Builds the app for production. The optimized build is saved in the `build` folder and can be deployed to any hosting platform.

## **Connecting to the Backend**

This client communicates with a backend **URL Shortener API** that handles URL shortening and analytics. Here’s what happens:

- **Create Short URL**: The frontend sends a request to the backend to shorten a long URL.
- **Get Analytics**: The frontend asks the backend for click data and displays it if requested.

To make sure everything works, keep the backend running!
